# Cute spot

This is a very basic CRUD app built with node & express. It has signup, login, basic auth stuff (with Passport, not from scratch, sorry). Cute spot has 3 models, user, spot, and review. Both spot and review are CRUDable.

It's a pretty generic, bootstrappy project, but maybe nice to look at if you're doing a bootcamp like I am ╰(◕ᗜ◕)╯

Also, I tried to comment the fuck out of everything, so that might be nice to look at too (if you're a baby dev like me).

## Motivation

I made cute spot for a web dev bootcamp... It's my second project.

## Prerequisites

The prereqs for this project are in the package.json file... I guess you need node ¯*(ツ)*/¯ Yes! That's a prereq. You definitely need nodejs.

Oh! If you want to contribute that's super nice. Make a pull request and explain your whole deal I guess? I actually have no idea why you would want to contribute to my basic bitch of an app though. So this section seems silly.
